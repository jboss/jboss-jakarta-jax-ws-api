== Introduction

This specification defines the Web Services for Jakarta EE (WSEE)
architecture. This is a service architecture that leverages the Jakarta EE
component architecture to provide a client and server programming model
which is portable and interoperable across application servers, provides
a scalable secure environment, and yet is familiar to Jakarta EE
developers.

=== Target Audience

This specification is intended to be used by:

* Jakarta EE Vendors implementing support for Web services compliant with
this specification
* Developers of Web service implementations to be deployed into Jakarta EE
application servers
* Developers of Web service clients to be deployed into Jakarta EE
application servers
* Developers of Web service clients that access Web service
implementations deployed into Jakarta EE application servers

This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with the Jakarta EE
platform and specifications. It also assumes that the reader is familiar
with Web services, specifically the Jakarta XML Web Services Specification
and WSDL documents.

=== Acknowledgments

This specificationâ€™s origins are based on the vision of Donald F.
Ferguson, IBM Fellow. It has been refined by an industry wide expert
group. The expert group included active representation from the
following companies: IBM, Sun, Oracle, BEA, Sonic Software, SAP, HP,
Silverstream, IONA. We would like to thank those companies along with
other members of the JSR 109 expert group: EDS, Macromedia, Interwoven,
Rational Software, Developmentor, interKeel, Borland, Cisco Systems,
ATG, WebGain, Sybase, Motorola, and WebMethods. We particularly
appreciate the amount of input and support provided by Mark Hapner
(Sun).

The JSR 109 expert group had to coordinate with other JSR expert groups
in order to define a consistent programming model for Web Service for
J2EE. We would like to especially thank Rahul Sharma and the JSR 101
(JAX-RPC) expert group, Farukh Najmi and the JSR 093 (JAX-R) expert
group, and Linda G. DeMichiel and the JSR 153 (EJB 2.1) expert group.

We would also like to acknowledge Roberto Chinnici (JSR-224
Specification Lead), Bill Shannon (JSR-244 Java EE Specification Lead),
Rajiv Mordani (JSR-250 Specification Lead), Jitendra Kotamraju, Doug
Kohlert, Vivek Pandey, Jerome Dochez, Vijay Ramachandran, Mahesh Kannan
and Kenneth Saks (all from Sun Microsystems) for providing invaluable
technical input for the maintenance release (version 1.2) of JSR-109
specification.

We would like to thank Roberto Chinnici (Java EE 6 Specification Lead),
Bill Shannon (Java EE 6 Specification Lead), Kenneth Saks (EJB 3.1
Specification Lead), Bhakti Mehta and Rama Pulavarthi (all from Sun
Microsystems) for providing invaluable input for the 1.3 maintenance
release.

=== Specification Organization

The next two chapters of this specification outline the requirements and
conceptual architecture for Web services support in Jakarta EE
environments. Each of the major integration points for Web services in
Jakarta EE, the client model, the server model, the deployment model, WSDL
bindings, and security have their own chapter. Each of these chapters
consists of two topics: Concepts and Specification. The concepts section
discusses how Web services are used, issues, considerations, and the
scenarios that are supported. The specification section is normative and
defines what implementers of this specification must support.

=== Document conventions.

In the interest of consistency, this specification attempts to follow the
document conventions used by other Jakarta EE specifications.

The regular Times font is used for information that is prescriptive by
this specification.

The _italic Times font_ is used for paragraphs that contain descriptive
information, such as notes describing typical use, or notes clarifying
the text with prescriptive specification.

The `Courier font` is used for code examples.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
