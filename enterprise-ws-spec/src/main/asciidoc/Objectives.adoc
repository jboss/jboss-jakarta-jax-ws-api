== Objectives

This section lists the high level objectives of this specification.

* Build on the evolving industry standards for Web services,
specifically WSDL 1.1, SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2.
* Leverage existing Jakarta EE technology.
* Ensure that programmers may implement and package Web services that
properly deploy onto application servers that comply with Jakarta EE and
this specification.
* Ensure that vendor implementations of this specification
inter-operate, i.e. a Web service client on one vendorâ€™s implementation
must be able to interact with Web services executing on another vendors
implementation.
* Define the minimal set of new concepts, interfaces, file formats, etc.
necessary to support Web services within Jakarta EE.
* Clearly and succinctly define functions that Jakarta EE application
server vendors need to provide.
* Define the roles that this specification requires, the functions they
perform and their mapping to Jakarta EE platform roles. Define the
functions that a Web Services for Jakarta EE product provider must provide
to support these roles.
* Support a simple model for defining a new Web service and deploying
this into a Jakarta EE application server.

=== Client Model Goals

The client programming model should be conformant and compatible with
the client programming model defined by Jakarta XML Web Services.

Additional goals for the client programming model are to ensure that:

* Programmers can implement Web services client applications conforming
to this specification that may reside in a Jakarta EE container (e.g. an
EJB that uses a Web service), or a Jakarta EE Client Container can call a
Web service running in a Web Services for Jakarta EE container.
* Client applications conforming to this specification can call any SOAP
1.1 or SOAP 1.2 based Web service through the HTTP 1.1 or HTTPS SOAP
Bindings.
* Programmers using other client environments can call a Web service
running in a Web Services for Jakarta EE container. Programmers using
languages other than Java must be able to implement SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2
compliant applications that can use Web services conforming to this
specification. Support the Client Development Scenarios described in
<<ClientProgrammingModel.adoc#anchor-13, Chapter 4>>.
* Client developers must not have to be aware of how the service
implementation is realized.

=== Service Development Goals

The service development model defines how web service implementations
are to be developed and deployed into existing Jakarta EE containers and
includes the following specific goals:

* How the Web service has been implemented should be transparent to the
Web service client. A client should not have to know if the Web service
has been deployed in a Jakarta EE or non-Jakarta EE environment.
* Because the Web service implementation must be deployed in a Jakarta EE
container, the class implementing the service must conform to some
defined requirements to ensure that it does not compromise the integrity
of the application server.
* This specification defines the Jakarta EE container based (Web and EJB)
runtime such that it is consistent with the programming model defined by
the Jakarta XML Web Services specification.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
Jakarta EE Stateless or Singleton Session Beans.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
Jakarta XML Web Services Service Endpoint classes in the Web Container.

=== Service Deployment Goals

* Web service deployment is declarative. We do this through extending
the Jakarta EE model for deployment descriptors and EAR file format. These
changes are minimized, however.
* Web service deployment is supported on Jakarta EE environments.
* Deployment requires that a service be representable by WSDL.
Deployment requires a WSDL file. The deployment of Web services must
support:

** those who wish to deploy a Web service as the focus of the deployment
** those who wish to expose existing, deployed Jakarta EE components as a
Web service

=== Service Publication Goals

* Service deployment may publish the WSDL to the appropriate service
registry, repository (if required by the Web service), File, or URL.
* If a Web service needs to be published by the deployment tools, all of
the data required to perform the publication must be provided in the
deployment package or during the deployment process.
* If any publication to UDDI is performed, the WSDL must also be made
available at a URL.
